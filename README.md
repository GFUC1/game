## Project Story / Background

This project started as an experiment and quickly turned into a learning-heavy experience.
Gil originally wanted to try **3D development** using an engine he had previously only used for **2D projects**. While he quickly realized that working in 3D was far more complex than expected (and mildly regrettable at times), it became a valuable learning experience.

The project also marked **our first time developing a multiplayer game**, which introduced additional challenges such as player synchronization, networking logic, and state handling. Although multiplayer was complicated to implement, the process helped us better understand how real-time multiplayer systems function, especially in a 3D environment.

Despite the difficulties, the project succeeded in combining basic FPS mechanics with multiplayer functionality, making it both a challenging and rewarding experience.
